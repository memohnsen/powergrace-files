Hey welcome to the team! Super pumped to have you! I’ve got a couple things to get you started.

1. Grace should’ve already added you into CoachNow. This is where you’ll upload videos and get feedback.
2. One of our big things here is family. Building a team dynamic in a remote environment is difficult so we utilize an app called Slack to help our athletes connect. This is simply a fancy group chat app with different channels and other features. Here is the link to join.

4. Lastly, I’d love to set up a time for a video call so we can talk through everything to get you started and get to know each other. Here’s the link to my calendar so you can schedule a time that fits best. If no times work just let me know and I’ll try to make some room. [https://fantastical.app/memohnsen/onboarding](https://fantastical.app/memohnsen/onboarding)

Let me know if you have any immediate questions otherwise we will talk soon on your onboarding call!
